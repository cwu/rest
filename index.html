          <p>
            Rest is a sleep monitoring system capable of measuring a user's sleep
            activity while not interfering with their natural sleeping habit. Rest
            automatically records a user's sleep activity and then uploads the
            data to a web server for analytics processing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our technology utilizes a combination of sensors to scientifically
            determine a user’s sleeping cycle, through actigraphy, as well as
            their sleeping posture. Using the sleep data, the system provides
            visual metrics such as sleep efficiency and posture to the user
            through a web interface.
          </p>

          <p>
            Rest aims to provide accurate sleep metrics to individuals that
            suffer from sleep disorders such as sleep apnea and insomnia, or just
            want to optimize their daily performance, in the comfort of their own
            home.

          <h2>Needs</h2>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            As technology becomes more accessible, consumers are able to gain more
            insights on their daily performance and habits, and use the feedback
            to improve overall quality of life. However, one major component of
            our daily routine has not been sufficiently explored, and that is sleep.
            Although poor rest quality and health symptoms such as diabetes have been
            publicly correlated [1], sleep information such as efficiency and posture
            are still not easily accessible to average consumers due to the cost and
            inconvenience of evaluation methods.
          </p>

          <h3>Needs Assesment</h3>
          <p>
            People are often not getting enough high quality sleep that they need,
            and do not have the accurate and accessible insight required to improve
            their sleeping habits. For example, diagnosis for insomnia is difficult
            due to data ambiguity, and would be a lot more defensible with
            quantifiable criteria and results. [1] A non-intrusive and cost-effective
            method is needed to inform people of their behaviour, and provide
            suggestions to benefit their overall quality of life.

          </p>
          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            To design and manufacture an affordable device capable of accurately
            measuring and visualizing a person’s sleep behavior while not
            interfering with their natural sleeping habit.
          </p>
          <h3>Objectives</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Does not interfere with user’s natural sleeping habit</li>
            <li>Record movement data and determine when the user is sleeping.</li>

        <article id="technology">
          <h2>Technology</h2>
          <p>
            The system uses a fusion of accelerometers and force sensing resistors
            to capture movement data as well as a user profile to detect posture.
            These sensors can be embedded into or placed under the bed sheets.
            This approach takes advantage of the different types of sensors to
            accurately capture relevant data to the sleep analysis. It can also
            be install non-intrusively under the bed sheet, with little hassle to
            install.
          </p>
          <p>
            The software is used to record the data, implement the analysis
            algorithm and present it to the user. It pipelines the data along
            different platforms from the sensor capture to the presentation to
            the user.
          </p>

          <h3>Sensor Matrix</h3>
          <div class="center">
            <img src="images/sensor_matrix.png" alt="Sensor Matrix" />
          </div>
          <p>
            For a standard single mattress, the sensor matrix consists of 30 force
            sensing resistors in a 6x5 grid. The force sensing resistors measure
            the user's weight distribution and the system can then determine the
            user's sleeping position.
          </p>

          <h3>Accelerometer</h3>
          <div class="center">
            <img src="images/accelerometer.jpg" alt="accelerometer" />
          </div>

          <p>
            The system has two accelerometers, placed on opposite corners of the
            bed, which measure the user's sleep movement for further analysis.
          </p>

          <h3>Microcontroller</h3>
          <div class="center">
            <img src="images/arduino.jpg" alt="Arduino Uno" />
          </div>

          <p>
            The microcontroller platform is the Arduino Uno. The Aruino is
            responsible for integrating the sensors to the software of the
            system.
          </p>

          <h3>Software</h3>
          <div class="center">
            <img src="images/visualization.png" alt="Arduino Uno" />
          </div>

          <p>
            The software can be separated into five main components:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Data capture</li>
            <li>Data transfer</li>
            <li>Data storage</li>
            <li>Data analysis</li>
            <li>Data presentation</li>
          </ol>


          <h3>Data Capture</h3>

          <p>
            The microcontroller interfaces with the accelerometers through I2C and
            the force sensing resistors through analog inputs.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Transfer</h3>

          <p>
            The data transfer occurs over the Internet using a Wi-Fi shield
            connected to the microcontroller.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Storage</h3>

          <p>
            As the data is transferred to the server, the server stores the data.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Analysis</h3>

          <p>
            The sleep movement data is analyzed using actigraphy, and correlated to
            different sleeping cycles. From the user's weight distribution data is
            analyzed, the system can determine the user's sleeping position.
          </p>

          <h3>Data Presenation</h3>

          <p>
            The sleep data is visually presented to the user in the form of various graphs.
