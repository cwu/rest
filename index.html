        <h3>Problem to Solve</h3>
        <p>
          Many people today do not have a healthy nights rest. Bad sleep patterns
          negatively affect a person's daily function, productivity and health.

          <blockquote>
            43% wake up greater than once nightly
            - Central Michigan University
          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>
            [bad sleep] leads to 47% higher risk of heart attack
            - National Post
          </blockquote>

          However there is no easy way to get insight into our sleeping behaviour
          which both easy to use and non-intrusive.

        <h3>What is Rest?</h3>
        <p>
          Rest is is an affordable device that can accurately measure one's sleep
          behaviour without interfering with their natural sleeping habits.
        </p>

        <h3>How does it Work?</h3>
        <p>
          Rest uses actigraphy to detect the sleeping phases. It is 94% accurate with
          traditional methods such as polysomnography.
